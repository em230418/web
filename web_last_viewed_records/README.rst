Last viewed records
===================

The module shows links to last viewed records and pages.

The module doesn't affect on server performance, because it uses
browser's localStorage to save history. But dissadvantage is that
history is not synced accross browsers.

Usage
=====

There are no any settings to configure. Just install module and continue to use odoo in a usual way. You will see links to last visited pages.
